# Write...Read...Action!

Many films have turned to books as plot sources. It seems that any book can be considered to become a movie. But the translation from paper to film is difficult for certain genres and not every book is deemed "worthy" for such a huge project. Also, it's not feasible to produce a film adaption for every single book. So what features of a book entails it to have a film adaption? This project will explore those features to see if one can predict the likelihood of a film adapation for a book.

## Background
I am appealing to two audiences: book/movie lovers and film producers. As an avid reader, I enjoy reading books of various genres and topics--some of which I deem worthy for a movie but hasn't been made into fruition. This project can highlight "hidden gems" or advocate for books. For film producers, they could do a pre-screening of books to consider.

Features considered:
```
- year of publication
- sales in first year, 5 years, 10 years, etc.
- publishing company
- book length - number of pages, words, sentences, etc.
- genre
- age demographics - children, teens, adults
- awards won
- bestsellers list
```

## Data Collection
Data will be obtained through:
```
- Kaggle (movies, books)
- New York Times API (books)
- Web scraping (books)
- Google Books API (books)
```

## Data Analysis
As this is a classification problem (movie or not), I will use decision trees and logistic regression models to predict which works become a source for a visual work. 

## Presentation
- Slideshow presentation about my data analysis (priority)
- Web app that operates like a recommender system where I can provide basic info about the work that I am interested in and see the likelihood that it will become a film (bonus)
