Proposal: Will a literary work have a film adaption?

When there is a film adpation of a book coming to theaters, I try to read a book beforehand to see if the film is worth watching. But there are times where I want to read and predict whether a literary work will have a film adaption in the future.

There are many variables to consider:
- year of publication
- number of awards won -- distinguish between prestigious and local
- author's reputation (determined by number books already published)
- publishing company
- sales in the first year
- genre
- type of literary work--book, graphic novel, etc.

As film did not become well-established until the 1900s, the focus will be on post-1900 literature--including graphic novels and plays. (The time frame may be further refined if too broad).
