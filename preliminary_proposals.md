# Proposal 1: Will a literary work have a film adaption?

When there is a film adpation of a book coming to theaters, I try to read a book beforehand to see if the film is worth watching. But there are times where I want to read and predict whether a literary work will have a film adaption in the future.

There are many variables to consider:
- year of publication
- number of awards won -- distinguish between prestigious and local, etc.
- author's reputation (determined by number books already published)
- publishing company
- sales in the first year
- book length, i.e. number of pages, words, etc.
- whether or not first edition sold out
- genre
- type of literary work--book, graphic novel, etc.
- published in other languages?
- age demographic, i.e. appropriate for children, teens, adult

As film did not become well-established until the 1900s, the focus will be on post-1900 literature--including graphic novels and plays.

As this is a classification problem, I will use decision trees and logistic regression models to predict which works become a source for a visual work. My work will be presented in slide presentations and if there is enough time, my goal is to make a web app--similar to a recommender system--where I can provide basic info about the work that I am interested in and see the likelihood that it will become a film.

The next step of this project is to collect data and see if this problem can be modeled.

# Proposal 2: Do restaurant health inspection scores and food critic scores correlate with customer feedback?
Many use the top restaurant review sites such as Yelp or Zagat to make their choice of restaurant. However, these reviews are all customer feedback and few sites incorporate health inspection scores and food critic scores. Would these selections change if a potential customer is able to review all three variables? Or are there other variables worth considering when calculating whether or not the restaurant be a good fit for you? (For example, I do not like spicy food. If I am not familiar with the dish/cuisine and all the reviews described it as "good", how will I know that the other items on the menu be of my liking?) I will explore potential variables besides reviews and scores to see if a model can help make a better choice for you.

Considering the following variables:
- Cuisine
- Length of operation
- Price range of menu items
- Scipy index?

My focus will be the Austin area--where I am able to access the local health inspection scores. If this project is chosen, I will include other cities that an Austin local may look for restaurants.

As this is a classification problem, I will use decision trees and linear regression models to predict which restaurants be a "good fit". My work will be presented in slide presentations and if there is enough time, my goal is to make a web app--similar to a recommender system--where I provide the restaurant name and see the ratings and reviews assocaited with it.

The next step of this project is to collect data and see if this problem can be modeled.

# Proposal 3: ATLAS Higgs Machine Learning Challenge

In 2014, there was a challenge hosted by CERN "to develop an algorithm that improved the detection of the Higgs boson signal. The specific sample used simulated Higgs particles into two tau particles inside the ATLAS detector." Due to high public demand, the dataset is now permanently available for public use.

As this project is publically available, the goal of this project is whether or not I am able to offer a different approach than what others have attempted. My work will be presented in slide presentations where I can show comparisons between my work and the work of others.

The next step of this project is to work on the data and try to approach the problem based on the skills and material that I learned during the Galvanize course.
