# Proposal 1: Will a literary work have a film adaption?

When there is a film adpation of a book coming to theaters, I try to read a book beforehand to see if the film is worth watching. But there are times where I want to read and predict whether a literary work will have a film adaption in the future.

There are many variables to consider:
- year of publication
- number of awards won -- distinguish between prestigious and local
- author's reputation (determined by number books already published)
- publishing company
- sales in the first year
- number of copies published vs sales
- genre
- type of literary work--book, graphic novel, etc.

As film did not become well-established until the 1900s, the focus will be on post-1900 literature--including graphic novels and plays.

Data: ?

As this is a classification problem, I will use decision trees and linear regression models to predict which works become a source for a visual work. My work will be presented in slide presentations and if there is enough time, my goal is to make a web app--similar to a recommender system--where I can provide basic info about the work that I am interested in and see the likelihood that it will become a film.

# Proposal 2: ATLAS Higgs Machine Learning Challenge

In 2014, there was a challenge hosted by CERN "to develop an algorithm that improved the detection of the Higgs boson signal. The specific sample used simulated Higgs particles into two tau particles inside the ATLAS detector." Due to high public demand, the dataset is now permanently available for public use.
